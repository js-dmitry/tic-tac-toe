# TIC-TAC-TOE

This is a test project to demosntrate the usage of `react`, `redux`, `redux-saga` and `flow`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
